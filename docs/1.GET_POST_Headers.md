# API Request Response Headers

1. Some header fields are modified for privacy or security reasons.
2. And some header fields are optional.
3. So the GET method will give the initial vqd_id.
4. That vqd_id is used to maintain the chat session.
5. Once we got the initial vqd_id we can use it with the POST method to send the new prompt.
6. Once we get the response we will get the new vqd_id and we will use the same vqd_id to send the next prompt.
7. But the catch is we have to maintain the history of the prompt made by user and response from the assistant, which will be used for next prompt payload.
8. i.e we have to append the response of the assistant for every prompt we made before appending the new prompt to the payload.

## Here is the real time example

1. First, GET method with the mentioned Request headers will be used to get the initial vqd_id.
2. Then, we will send the first payload with the last vqd_id to get the response from the first POST method.

   ```txt
   {
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "message": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello"
      }
    ]
   }
   ```

3. Once we get the response we will get the new vqd_id and we will use the same vqd_id to send the next prompt and also the response from the assistant is appended to the payload before appending the new prompt.

   ```json
   {
     "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
     "message": [
       {
         "role": "user",
         "content": "Hello"
       },
       {
         "role": "assistant",
         "content": "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. Then with the new vqd_id and the new user prompt, we will send the payload to get the response from the second POST method.

   ```json
   {
     "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
     "message": [
       {
         "role": "user",
         "content": "Hello"
       },
       {
         "role": "assistant",
         "content": "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
       },
       {
         "role": "user",
         "content": "new prompt"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

```txt
# response for GET

{"status":"0"}
```

> - The first vqd_id from the GET Method will be hidden from the inspect feature of the browser.
>
> - We can get the vqd_id from the response of the GET Method using the header field `x-vqd-accept: 1` (note: this is only used in GET Method, no need to include this in POST method header)
>
> - I used `POSTMAN` (platform for collaborative API development) to simulate above mentioned conditions
>
> - And not that the GET method and POST method endpoint are not the same, but the GET method is used to get the initial vqd_id and the POST method is used to send the payload to get the response from the assistant.
>
> GET uses `https://duckduckgo.com/duckchat/v1/status` and
>
> POST uses `https://duckduckgo.com/duckchat/v1/chat`

## POST METHOD Request and Response

> - The POST method response is recieved as event-stream
>
> - And notice that vqd_id in Request header and Response header are different
